# Problem Statement
# Write a program that continually reads in mass from the user and then outputs the equivalent energy using Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula (E stands for energy, m stands for mass, and C is the speed of light:

# Solution 
# C = 299792458  # the speed of light and its value will be constant

# def main():
# # get mass in kgs from user 
#    mass_in_kgs: float = float(input("Enter mass in kilos: "))

#    # Calculate the energy 
#     # equavalently energy = mass * (C ** 2)
#     # using ** operator to raise C to power 2
#    energy_in_joules: float = mass_in_kgs * (C ** 2)
   
#    #show the work to user 
#    print("e = m * (C ** 2 )")
#    print(f"m = {mass_in_kgs} kg")
#    print(f"C = {C} m/s")
     
#    print(f"{str(energy_in_joules)} joules of energy!")  


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
