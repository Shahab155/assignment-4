# Problem Statement

# Use Python to calculate the number of seconds in a year, and tell the user what the result is in a nice print statement that looks like this (of course the value 5 should be the calculated number instead):

# Solution 

# DAYS_IN_YEAR = 365
# HOURS_IN_DAY = 24 
# MINUTES_IN_HOUR = 60
# SECONDS_IN_MINUTE = 60


# def main():
#     #  get the year as input from user 
#  try:
#     year: int =  int(input("Enter number of years to convert into seconds: "))

#     number_of_seconds: int = (DAYS_IN_YEAR * HOURS_IN_DAY * MINUTES_IN_HOUR * SECONDS_IN_MINUTE) * year
    
#     print(f"The number of second in {year} years is: {number_of_seconds} seconds.")
#  except:
#     print("Please enter a valid number.")


# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
