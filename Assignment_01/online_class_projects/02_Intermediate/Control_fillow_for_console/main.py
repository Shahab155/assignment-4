# Problem: High Low

# We want you to gain more experience working with control flow and Booleans in Python. To do this, we are going to have you develop a game! The game is called High-Low and the way it's played goes as follows:

# Two numbers are generated from 1 to 100 (inclusive on both ends): one for you and one for a computer, who will be your opponent. You can see your number, but not the computer's!

# You make a guess, saying your number is either higher than or lower than the computer's number

# If your guess matches the truth (ex. you guess your number is higher, and then your number is actually higher than the computer's), you get a point!

# These steps make up one round of the game. The game is over after all rounds have been played.
